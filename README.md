# SMeTD
Program for SMeTD temperature sensors


  This is a (Arduino) program to read six temperature sensors based on the MCP98078
  microchip.  It has been designed for Eva Loerke, a student at The James
  Hutton Institute, and will be used to measure the temperature of water
  at depths of: Surface, 5cm below surface and then further depths of 10cm, 20cm,
  35cm and 55cm. (However, these depths can be amended at any time.) The air temperature
  will also be logged.
  The unit, and its associated software, has been designed and built by
  David Drummond of The James Hutton Institute.
